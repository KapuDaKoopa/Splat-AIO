-- All Gear only gives you non-levelup and non-
special gear (like Splatfest Tee) for now, to
try and keep saves safe. You can still get level-
up gear by speaking to Judd with a high enough level.

-- Using the update option now leads to
./Resources/run/extra/update_beta2.py . It's
much less vague in what it's doing, and won't start
changing the currently existing /run/ folder until
it's finished downloading what it needs to. If it
says it's downloading, it's still downloading and
you're safe to stop it. There's still some holes
that need patching up though.

-- Preparing to give you the option to view a list of
changes from the past so you don't get lost.

-- Still no credits yet. q.q

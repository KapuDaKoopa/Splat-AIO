-Gecko DotNet should work a little bit better now for 5.5.x.
Hopefully.

-You can run Gecko and Cafiine at the same time now, just
as a bit of a notice. go to [ http://tinyurl.com/geckiine ]
if you're interested in doing that (it means OctoSFX + Octohax!)

-..that's all, the Gecko thing was bothering me *that* much.
Was too lazy to even add this update to the list for now.

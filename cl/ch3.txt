-- All Gear only gives you non-levelup and non-
special gear (like Splatfest Tee) for now, to
try and keep saves safe. You can still get level-
up gear by speaking to Judd with a high enough level.

-- Added the ability to change your Mii's name to what-
ever you want. And with it, an Otherhax category.

-- Using the update option now leads to
./Resources/run/extra/update_beta2.py . It's
much less vague in what it's doing, and won't start
changing the currently existing /run/ folder until
it's finished downloading what it needs to.

-- Preparing to give you the option to view a list of
changes from the past so you don't get lost.

-- Still no credits yet. q.q

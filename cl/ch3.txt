-- All Gear only gives you non-levelup and non-
special gear (like Splatfest Tee) for now to
try and keep saves safe. You can still get level-
up gear by speaking to Judd with a high enough level.
Weapons will still give you all normally obtainable
weapons though, so if you use that, keep track of which
ones you should be able to use and which ones you can't.
Or just be level 50.

-- Spoiler alert, that's the only actual change.

-- I tried to make a better updater, but then I realized
that I can only easily make changes to the /run/ folder,
and since everything in there gets deleted in the process
of updating... the updater gets deleted midway through.
...Kinda my fault, I made it work that way on purpose.

-- Preparing to give you the option to view a list of
changes from the past so you don't get lost.

-- Still no credits yet. q.q

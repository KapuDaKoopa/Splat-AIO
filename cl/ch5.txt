- Now with crappy changelog list.

- HBL scripts should work with CosmoCortney Gecko, so get that one
from the "Post Your Wii U Cheat Codes Here!" thread if you're using 
the one from the self-hosting thread...

- ...except for All Weapons, which was being weird and since I
don't have the time to look at it right now I disabled it for a
bit. Use Loadiine.ovh's Gecko if you want to use that.

-- All Gear only gives you non-levelup and non-
special gear (like Splatfest Tee) for now, to
try and keep saves safe. You can still get level-
up gear by speaking to Judd with a high enough level.

-- Added the ability to change your Mii's name to what-
ever you want. In the future when more hacks like this
come up, this will be put in an 'Otherhax' menu.

-- I tried to make a better updater, but then I realized
that I can only easily make changes to the /run/ folder,
and since everything in there gets deleted in the process
of updating... the updater gets deleted midway through.
...Kinda my fault, I made it work that way on purpose.

-- Preparing to give you the option to view a list of
changes from the past so you don't get lost.

-- Still no credits yet. q.q
